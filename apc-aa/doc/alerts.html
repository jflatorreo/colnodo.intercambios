It is necessary you understand how readers are managed by the <a href="reader.html" target="_top">Reader Management slices</a> first.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e45"></a>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>AA Alerts are designed to deliver new AA items to users by e-mail. Slice Administrators choose the design and which kind of items from which slices to include. Readers subscribe for receiving the news and select how often: immediately when the news becomes Active (in the meaning of the bins in Item Manager) or a daily, weekly or monthly digest.</p><p>Anonymous forms (see <a href="anonym.html" target="_top">doc</a>) allow users to change their subscriptions. Users are identified by e-mail and they must confirm their e-mail address by a confirmation code received by e-mail to make sure the address is working.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e55"></a>2.&nbsp;Email content</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>This section describes how are chosen the new items which appear in the email.</p><p>One Alerts module is one email from the reader's point of view. A set of Selections is assigned to the module. The Selections are defined in views of type &#8220;<span class="quote">Alerts Selection Set</span>&#8221;.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e65"></a>2.1.&nbsp;View Type &#8220;<span class="quote">Alerts Selection Set</span>&#8221;</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>You define this view in the slices, from which you want to send new items. The first check box, &#8220;<span class="quote">Group by selections</span>&#8221;, will be explained later. The view defines the Selections, which have a description and a set of the powerful <a href="???" target="_top"><tt class="constant">conds[]</tt> and <tt class="constant">sort[]</tt></a> parameters, the same as are used with <tt class="constant">slice.php3</tt> in search forms. You can e.g. create one selection for each category. When you open an Alerts view, there are always two empty pairs of boxes for two new Selections. If you want to define more Selections, store the view settings and reopen it.</p><p>You can add Selections from several views and several slices to one Alerts module. Readers may choose which selections they want to receive. Some items may pass the <tt class="constant">conds[]</tt> conditions of several Selections. If you check &#8220;<span class="quote">Group by selections</span>&#8221;, the view is generated for each Selection and some items may appear several times in the email. If you leave &#8220;<span class="quote">Group by selections</span>&#8221; unchecked, first all items which pass the reader's Selections are collected and the view is generated only once for all of them.</p><p>The setting &#8220;<span class="quote">Fulltext URL</span>&#8221; links to the page where is an item viewed when the reader clicks on its headline in the email. Of course if you do not add a linked headline to the view design, this setting is not used.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e101"></a>3.&nbsp;Alerts module</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>The Alerts module appears like other regular modules in the slice select box.

Selections are defined in views of type Alerts Selection Set in the slices from which you want to send new items. Each selection has a description and a set of the Mind that if some item appears in several selections, it will be repeated in the mail. Try to make selections mutually exclusive.</td></tr><tr><td>Send emails</td><td>You can manually send the digest to all readers. And you can send an example email to yourself to see exactly what readers receive.</td></tr><tr><td>Reader Management</td><td>Sets the Reader Management Slice which feeds this Alerts. Allows to add, delete and refresh the Alerts-specific fields to the slice. When you change the list on the Selections page, use Sync to refresh the appropriate constant group in the Reader Management Slice.</td></tr><tr><td>Email Templates</td><td>Allows to edit all email templates.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The fields added by Sync with reader slice are:</p><div class="table"><a name="d0e138"></a><p class="title"><b>Table&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Alerts specific fields</b></p><table summary="Alerts specific fields" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>how often</td><td>How often the reader receives a digest: instant (each new item in one e-mail), daily, weekly, monthly.</td></tr><tr><td>choose selections</td><td>Multiple checkboxes allowing to choose which selections from the collection the reader wants to read.

This allows a completely free design. The formatted new items are added by the <tt class="constant">_#FILTERS_</tt> alias. If you want to send different texts to readers with different &#8220;<span class="quote">how often</span>&#8221;, use the <tt class="constant">switch</tt> function on the alias <tt class="constant">_#HOWOFTEN</tt>. To allow readers to confirm their email and change their personal settings, use the alias <tt class="constant">_#COLLFORM</tt>, which is the URL you filled in Alerts Admin - Settings, with an additional 9 letters parameter containing the <a href="#">access code</a>.</p><p>An example of both email types is added by <tt class="constant">sql_update</tt>.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e217"></a>4.&nbsp;Sending emails</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>There are two ways of sending the emails: regularly by cron or manually.</p><p>The cron items are added to the <tt class="constant">cron</tt> table automatically by <tt class="constant">sql_update.php3</tt>. You must set up cron on your server, <a href="http://apc-aa.sourceforge.net/faq#cron" target="_top">see FAQ</a>. There are four items for the four different frequencies (instant, daily, weekly, monthly). The info when were which Alerts module emails generated is stored in the table <tt class="constant">alerts_collection_howoften</tt>. The emails are created so that readers see the HTML version in e-mail clients supporting HTML and the text version in clients supporting text only. The text form is created by deleting all HTML tags. Technically speaking, it is a MIME multi-part/alternative message with a text part and a HTML part.</p><p>If you want to send emails manually, use the &#8220;<span class="quote">Send emails</span>&#8221; page in the Alerts module.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e241"></a>5.&nbsp;Step by step tutorial</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>Here is a tutorial, describing in steps how you can try the Alerts module. </p><p>WARNING: The result does not use Authorization, the personal info is protected by a password.
