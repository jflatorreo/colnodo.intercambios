<h2><a name="s4">4. Installation of ActionApps</a></h2>
<h2><a name="ss4.1">4.1 Installation</a> </h2>
<p>APC-AA software is just a bunch of php scripts - human (though php
savvy) readable files. There no binaries or anything else to be worried
about. The whole installation task means getting the files and copy them
into some directory. There are two options how to install APC-AA. You
can either: <br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>download latest SVN version via Subversion (SVN)</li>
  <li>download the latest stable version in zipped format</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing the ActionApps via Subversion (SVN) makes it easy to update later. The
problem is that SVN repository is mainly intended for developers and
thus always contains latest development version, which doesn't always
have to be stable, and may contain bugs. On the other hand, you will
get latest features and known bug fixes. The rule-of-thumb is if you
need fetures that are currently being developed, than use SVN. If it's
quite unlikely that you will need to update APC-AA very often, than
stick on stable releases. </p>
<p> The exact details will depend on whether your machine is serving
multiple Virtual Domains and if so, whether ActionApps is to be made
available to all the domains or not. </p>
<p>ActionApps can be installed either in some common location, or
inside one of the Virtual Hosts, the example below assumes that
ActionApps is installed in a common location, "/home/httpd/" </p>
<h3><a name="ss4.1.1">4.1.1 Installing via Subversion (SVN) for developers</a></h3>
<p>Developers should check the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/E09">Subversion (Version Control for Source Code)</a> item for an
alternative. </p>
<h3><a name="ss4.1.2">4.1.2 Installing via Subversion (SVN) for non-developers</a></h3>
<p>If you are installing from SVN repository, you must have subversion utility
installed on your machine. Check: </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre>
    <code>
# rpm -q subversion
# subversion-1.4.6-0.1.el4.rf
    </code>
  </pre>
  <hr>
</blockquote>
<p> SVN will automatically create the installation directory for you named apc-aa. </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre>
    <code>
# cd /home/httpd/
# svn co https://apc-aa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/apc-aa/trunk apc-aa
    </code>
  </pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<h3><a name="ss4.1.3">4.1.3 Installing the stable release via FTP</a></h3>
<p>If you want to install the latest stable version rather than the one
from SVN, download it from <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apc-aa/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/apc-aa/</a>
to the hard drive (let's say to <code>/tmp</code>) and than untar </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre>
    <code>
# cd /home/httpd/
#  tar -xvzf /tmp/apc-aa-2.8.0.tgz
    </code>
  </pre>
  <hr>
</blockquote>
This will create directory /home/httpd/apc-aa-2.8.0, which you can
rename to apc-aa or whatever is convenient for you.
<p></p>
<p>If you have no shell access on the machine, then you can download
this code, and FTP it into a directory on your web site</p>
<p>If you want ActionApps available to all domains, then add this line
in the global context with the other Aliases, otherwise you can add
it to each Virtual domain where you want to make ActionApps
available. </p>
<p>Note that you do NOT need to do this for a virtual domain IF
ActionApps is installed directly in that domains web site. </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre>
    <code>
      Alias /apc-aa/ /home/httpd/apc-aa/
    </code>
  </pre>
  <hr>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a name="ss4.1.4">4.1.4 Configuring ActionApps</a></h3>
<p>Edit <code>/home/httpd/html/apc-aa/include/config.php3</code>. </p>
<p>This is the main ActionApps configuration file. It contains comments
 which explain everything there. Note that this file may not contain
anything before the <code>&lt;?php</code> line at the top and after
the <code>?&gt;</code> line at the bottom. </p>
<p><b>The file <code>/home/httpd/html/apc-aa/include/config.php3</code>
now contains passwords. It should therefore not be world readable. On
the other hand, the http server must be able to read it. Read the
chapter on <a href="install-6.html#security">security</a> for a
possible solution for this problem.</b> </p>
<h2><a name="ss4.2">4.2 Creating the database</a></h2>
<p>There are two options depending on whether you have shell access, or
are running on an ISP's setup.</p>
<h3><a name="ss4.2.1">4.2.1 No shell access: Asking the ISP</a></h3>
<p>Ask the ISP to: </p>
<blockquote> Create a mysql database called "aadb", and a mysql user
with permission to CREATE,DROP,ALTER,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE on
this database. They should know what this means, and understand it
presents no security implications. </blockquote>
<h3><a name="ss4.2.2"></a>4.2.2 Shell access: creating it yourself</h3>
<p>Then create your initial ActionApps database. When queried for a
password, use the mysql root password. </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre><code>#  mysql -u root -p<br>Enter password:<br>mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE aadb;<br>Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)<br><br>mysql&gt; QUIT<br>Bye<br></code></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>Create a user in MySQL that will be able to access the new aadb
database. Note that the instructions below assumed you used
"localhost" as the MySQL server, if you set something else, then it
will typically be something like "aadbuser@machinename". This
username and password should match that set in config.php3 above. We
will refer to this password as the <em>aadbuser password</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre><code># mysql -u root -p<br>mysql&gt; USE mysql;<br>mysql&gt; GRANT CREATE,DROP,ALTER,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE<br>ON aadb.*<br>TO aadbuser@localhost<br>IDENTIFIED BY 'password2';<br>Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)<br><br>mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;<br>mysql&gt; quit<br></code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss4.3">4.3 Initializing the database and creating a
superadmin account</a> </h2>
<p>&nbsp; Once the database and account are created, point your Web
browser to <a href="http://localhost/apc-aa/service/sql_update.php">http://localhost/apc-aa/service/sql_update.php</a>.
If there are any error messages (which will show up in bold) these are
typically because the ISP has failed to give you one of the database
permissions requested above, or has set up authentication for the
database wrongly. </p>
<p>Point your Web browser to <a
 href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3</a>.
You should see a page with two buttons "Init" and "Recover", click
"Init" and you should receive a form where you can enter the
information for the SuperAdmin account. </p>
<p>If you don't get the form, just the same screen again, then check
your php settings if "register_globals = On" as described in <a
 href="install-3.html#ss3.7">3.7</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is just one question open: What is login name and password of
the initial superadmin account (which you need to create the first
slice)? The answer depends on the permission system you use. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using the LDAP based permission system, the superadmin
account is the one you created when you edited the initial LDIF
data file. At that time, you have also set a password for this
account. </li>
  <li>If you are using the sql based permission system, there is no
initial superadmin account so far. To create one, follow the
instructions below. </li>
</ul>
<p>ActionApps users who have the superadmin privilege may create new
slices in addition to the rights any slice administrator has. </p>
<p>Creating a superadmin account will be necessary whenever you don't
have one left. This is the case at installation time if you are using
the sql based permission system, and in case you have accidently
deleted the last superadmin account or accidently revoked the
superadmin privilege from the last superadmin account. To create a
superadmin account, follow these steps. </p>
<ul>
  <li>rename the file apc-aa/admin/setup.php.txt to
apc-aa/admin/setup.php </li>
  <li>go to <a href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3</a>
and press "Recover" </li>
  <li>rename the file apc-aa/admin/setup.php back to
apc-aa/admin/setup.php.txt for safety. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="ss4.4">4.4 File uploads and cron</a> </h2>
<p>If you want people to be able to use file uploads, you have to
create a directory where apache server can store uploaded files, and
which will accessible via the webserver. To do this, create the
directory under one of your sites, or create it somewhere else and
create an alias in httpd.conf to point at it. Make sure this directory
is the apache web server has write permissions for this directory. Look
for lines like <br>
</p>
<pre><code>

User apache
Group apache

</code></pre>
in your httpd.conf file in order to find out under which identity is
your web server running. Than set the right permisions. Example:
<blockquote><code> </code>
 <hr>
  <pre><code>
  # mkdir /var/www/uploads
  # chown apache:apache /var/www/uploads
  # chmod 775 /var/www/uploads/
  </code></pre>
  <code> </code>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>Edit apc-aa/include/config.php3, edit the defines IMG_UPLOAD_PATH
and IMG_UPLOAD_URL to point to this directory. Note the trailing "/".
</p>
<p>To stop someone uploading a PHP file and then executing it, edit
your httpd.conf file and add </p>
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre><code>
<directory>
 Options None
 php_flag engine off
</directory>
</code></pre>
  <hr></blockquote>
<p> For installing cron, please refer to the <a
 href="http://apc-aa.sourceforge.net/faq/">FAQ</a> page. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss4.5">4.5 Your first test slice</a> </h2>
<p>After creating the superadmin you will be thanked and either
directed to the Slice addition page <a
 href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3</a>
or direct to the Administration front end <a
 href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/index.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin</a>.
You should be able to log in now with the superadmin account you
created above. Refer to the <a
 href="https://www.apc.org/actionapps/english/manual/wmguide.html">APC
ActionApps User Manual Webmaster's guide</a>. </p>
