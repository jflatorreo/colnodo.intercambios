<h2><a name="ss7.1">7.1 Common problems</a></h2>
<p>There are certain issues with Apache 2 and PHP.&nbsp; If your web
server is Apache 2, make sure that you have the lastest PHP available.
At the time of 2.6.0 release, the oficial RedHat distribution contained
a a PHP rpm version with the unresolved <a
 href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=17868">bug.</a> The only way to
get this working is to download latest PHP and create RPM package
yourself. <br>
</p>
<p>If you experience some other problems, search the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=6341">mailinglists archives</a>
and don't hesitate to contact the community - there is lot's of people
who have enough experience with ActionApps installations and most of us
have seen various bugs. <br>

<h2><a name="ss7.2">7.2 Maintenance</a></h2>
<p>There is no maintenance to do, except that you must watch out always
to have enough disk space for all the data. If your cron script is set
properly, it optimizes the database according to AA cron setup. <br>
