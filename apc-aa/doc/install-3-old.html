<H2><A name=install_other></A><A name=s3>3. Installation of Other Packages
needed by ActionApps</A></H2>
<H2><A name=ss3.1>3.1 Platform</A> </H2>
<P>The installation instructions given here are intended for use with RedHat
Linux. We used version 6.0 and 6.2. This specifically means that the
<EM>rpm</EM> tool is used wherever possible.
<P><EM>If your system does not support the rpm tool</EM>, most procedures will
be quite different from what is shown here. You will probably have to do most
installations by building the software itself. It is beyond the scope of this
document to describe that although necessary configurations options will be
mentioned.
<P>
<H2><A name=ss3.2>3.2 MySQL database back end</A> </H2>
<P>Check if you have already MySQL 3.22.32 or newer installed:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  <PRE>% rpm -q MySQL</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If MySQL has been installed from source ,then RPM will report it is not installed,
  try &quot;ps efax | grep mysql&quot; to see if it is running, and if it is then
  either &quot;/usr/sbin/mysqld -V&quot; will report the version on newer versions.
  If this doesn't exist then running the client with, &quot;mysql&quot; should
  report the version number it is connected to.
<P>If it is not installed or if the version used is too old, install it. If you
  don't have a CD with MySQL RPM files, download it from <A
href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html</A>.
  (MySQL is <EM>not</EM> included in RedHat Linux.) Use the stable release version.
  Get files from the "standard binary RPMs" part: "<EM>Server for ... systems</EM>",
  "<EM>Client programs for ... systems</EM>" and "<EM>Include files and libraries
  for development for ... systems</EM>". (The latter is needed re recompile php
  if this has to be done, see below.)
<P>As root, install the RPMs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># rpm -Uv MySQL-3.22.32-1.i386.rpm
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>This command will install the MySQL database server, create
some administrative tables and already start the server itself. It also creates
a file in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</CODE> and symbolic links in
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/</CODE> so the server is started and stopped properly on
system start and shutdown.
<P>Also install the MySQL client tools and the development files and &quot;shared&quot;
  :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  </CODE>
  <PRE><code># rpm -Uv MySQL-client-3.23.43-1.i386.rpm
# rpm -Uv MySQL-devel-3.23.43-1.i386.rpm<br>#rpm -Uv MySQL-shared-3.23.43-1.i386.rpm</code></PRE>
  <CODE><HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Since the server is now running, it can be accessed. It is a
good idea to immediately set a password for the MySQL root user. Remind the
password - better not use <EM>mysqlpass</EM> for obvious reasons. We will refer
to this password as the <EM>mysql root password</EM>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># mysqladmin -u root password 'mysqlpass'
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;
<P>
<H2><A name=ss3.3>3.3 OpenLDAP</A> </H2>
<H3>Package Installation</H3>
<P>Note: You only need the OpenLDAP server if you decided to use LDAP as the
permission system. Only do this if you know what you are doing.  Generally, people use mysql as
their permission system<P>

If you to install OpenLDAP, see the <a href="ldap.html">apc-aa LDAP page</a>

<P>
<H2><A name=ss3.4>3.4 Installing the Apache Web Server</A> </H2>
<P>Use the RPM that comes from RedHat. We have had success with the versions
1.3.9 and 1.3.12. You need to install the "devel" packages, too.
<P>To find out which version of apache httpd you have, use:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% httpd -v
Server version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)  (Red Hat/Linux)
Server built:   Apr  7 1999 17:17:41
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To install the apache web server, use these commands. Not that in this
example, the apache itself was already installed, but the development package
was missing (this is the default case for RedHat Linux).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># rpm -Uv /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/apache-1.3.9-7.i386.rpm
package apache-1.3.9-7 is already installed
# rpm -Uv /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/apache-devel-1.3.9-7.i386.rpm
apache-devel-1.3.9-7
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Configuring the web server is a task for a later point in time because RPM
will do part of this work.
<P>
<H2><A name=php_install></A><A name=ss3.5>3.5 PHP3</A> </H2>
<H3>PHP installation</H3>
<P>php runs within the apache web server as a module. We need a version of php
  which includes support for <EM>two optional php modules</EM>, namely ldap and
  mysql. These modules provide access to ldap and mysql databases, respectively,
  from php programs. (If you don't use ldap with the ActionApps, you
  will not need the ldap php support.)
<P>There are many ways to install all this, and many can generate a lot of trouble.
  The cleanest and easiest way is, again, to use RPMs.
<P><b>Note that these instructions were written for installing PHP3. PHP4 has
  been tested and works, but noone so-far has followed these installation instructions,
  which have been edited for consistency with php4. An updated version of this
  section for PHP4 would be welcome.</b>
<P><b>There where problems with the RedHat RPM's for PHP4, and some other configuration
  problems which are detailed at the end of this section.</b>
<P>
<H3>Testing php installation</H3>
<P>First, create a test WWW page to find out the status of php support on your
  system. This can be done easily by executing this command (assuming <CODE>/home/httpd/html</CODE>
  is your DocumentRoot directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  <PRE>echo "&lt;?php phpinfo() ?&gt;" &gt; /home/httpd/html/test.php</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Access the page with a web browser (http://localhost/test.php).
<UL>
  <LI>If you see a page beginning with <CODE>PHP Version</CODE>, you have a working
    php. Browse through the <CODE>Configuration</CODE> section. Look for an extension
    named <CODE>MySQL</CODE> and, if you are using the LDAP permission system,
    for one named <CODE>LDAP</CODE>. If both are there, you are lucky because
    the php setup id complete; otherwise, you must install the missing parts.
  <li>If you see the string <code>php phpinfo() ?</code>, you do not have php4
    installed or at least it is not enabled. In which case, you can try again
    with a test file test.php3 which will work if the PHP3 is installed. APC-AA
    should work with this.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Installing PHP</H3>
<P>Unfortunately, as of this writing, there is no mysql support for php which
comes as an rpm made by RedHat. There are some mysql modules for php on the
RedHat server, but they are all for older versions of php.
<P>RedHat 6.1 and 6.2 above have a php rpm which is prepared for inclusion of
other php modules. The ldap module is provided. The mysql module is not
provided, but it is possible to build the mysql module. The advantage of going
this way is that you will have the RPMs which are easy to install on all your
machines and that the RPM install scripts will manage necessary configuration
file changes by themselves. The disadvantage is that the RPM build process
requires some more packages installed. This is described in the next section.
<P>If you don't want to use RPMs, you must build PHP the traditional way. This
is described in the sections following the next section.
<P>
<H3>Building the PHP RPMs including mysql</H3>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>To build the PHP RPMs including the mysql support, you need the following
  packages installed which you find at www.redhat.com:
  <UL>
    <LI>apache-devel
    <LI>imap-devel
    <LI>openldap-devel [ only if you are building openldap ]
    <LI>postgresql-devel [ only if you think you may want to use postgresql with this webserver ]
    <LI>MySQL-devel
    <LI>apache-devel (version 1.3.9 or newer)
    <LI>and there must be a general development environment. </LI></UL>
  <LI>In order to build RPMs, you need an RPM build environment. For a quick
  setup of this, use the following commands:
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    <HR>
<PRE>% mkdir ~/rpmbuild ~/rpmbuild/RPMS ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS ~/rpmbuild/BUILD ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES ~/rpmbuild/SPECS; echo "%_topdir ${HOME}/rpmbuild" &gt;~/.rpmmacros
</PRE>
    <HR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>You need the php source RPM from RedHat and install it (do not install it
  before you have the RPM build environment):
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    <HR>
<PRE>% rpm -Uv php-3.0.15-2.src.rpm
</PRE>
    <HR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>In this example, the php source rpm version 3.0.15-2 was
  used.
  <LI>Edit the file <CODE>~/rpmbuild/SPECS/php.spec</CODE>. This file is the
  description used by rpm to build the php packages, and the mysql section is
  commented out (this is the reason for the fact that there is no mysql module
  for php on the RedHat server). You need to uncomment all lines which concern
  mysql, and you need to add a section describing the mysql package. There is a
  patch which does the right thing for the version 3.0.15-2; the patch can be
  found in the ActionApps doc directory as <CODE>php-spec.patch</CODE>.
  To apply this patch, copy it to the <CODE>~/rpmbuild/SPECS</CODE> directory
  and use this command:
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    <HR>
<PRE>% cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS; patch &lt; php-spec.patch
</PRE>
    <HR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <LI>Run the rpm build process:
  <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    <HR>
<PRE>% rpm -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/php.spec
</PRE>
    <HR>
    </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>This will take some time. After everything is done, you
  will find all the RPMs in the directory <CODE>~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/</CODE>.
  </LI></OL>
<P>If you had already php installed, better uninstall it before you install the
new versions.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># rpm --erase --nodeps php php-manual php-mysql php-ldap php-pgsql php-imap
# rpm -iv php-3.0.15-2.i386.rpm php-manual-3.0.15-2.i386.rpm php-mysql-3.0.15-2.i386.rpm php-ldap-3.0.15-2.i386.rpm
php-3.0.15-2
php-manual-3.0.15-2
php-mysql-3.0.15-2
php-ldap-3.0.15-2
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>On installation, RPM will edit the apache web server configurations file
(<CODE>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</CODE>) and php initialization file
(<CODE>/etc/httpd/php.ini</CODE>) automatically.
<P>
<H3>Building PHP3 without RPMs</H3>
<P>If you don't want to use RPM for PHP3 installation, you can as well build it
from the scratch. If you want to do this, you will need
<UL>
  <LI>The PHP3 sources themselves. get them from <A
  href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">http://www.php.net/downloads.php</A>.
  <LI>The apache development files installed (apache-devel)
  <LI>The mysql development files installed (MySQL-devel)
  <LI>The openldap development files installed (openldap-devel) if you plan to
  use LDAP as the permission system. </LI></UL>
<P>Unpack the PHP3 distribution, change into that directory, configure and
build. This example shows a build <EM>with</EM> the LDAP module; remove the
<CODE>--with-ldap</CODE> if you don't use LDAP:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>
<H2><A name=ss3.6>3.6 Configuring the apache web server</A> </H2>
<P>During the PHP3 installation using RPMs, most of the configuration work for
the web server is already done. If you didn't use RPM to install PHP3, you might
have to do the following steps. (It does no harm to double check if everything
is configured correctly anyway.)
<P>The configuration for the apache takes place in the file
<CODE>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</CODE>.
<P>You will need the statement <CODE>Options +Includes</CODE> there. This
enables the so-called <EM>server side includes</EM> (SSI) which are used by the
page the users read (which contain the actual content). <B>This can be a
security problem</B> because whoever can edit these pages can run any command on
your web server. (<EM>IncludesNOEXEC</EM> is not enough.) You might want to
consider to enable this only for the directories where it is needed with
<EM>&lt;Directory&gt;</EM> statements. See also the chapter on <A
href="install-6.html#security">security</A> .
<P>In <CODE>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</CODE>, make sure these lines are not
commented out:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>and
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>

AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>"Commented out" means That they are prepended by a "#".
Remove the leading "#" from the lines if it is there.
<P>Add <CODE>index.php3</CODE> to the tt/DirectoryIndex/ line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.cgi index.php3
</PRE>
  <HR>

<P>Restart the web server to reread the configuration files:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After these configuration steps, PHP should work. You can test this by
browsing to your test page ( <A
href="http://localhost/test.php3">http://localhost/test.php3</A>) again.
<P>
<H2><A name=ss3.7>3.7 PHPLIB installation</A> </H2>
<P>Get PHPLIB from <A
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib">http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib</A>.
  Unpack it, create a directory at the same level as your http conf directory
  and extract the files from phplib's php directory to the new directory: For
  example, if your configuration files are in /etc/httpd/conf then create /etc/httpd/phplib.
  ActionApps have been tested with version 7.2b and 7.2d of phplib.
