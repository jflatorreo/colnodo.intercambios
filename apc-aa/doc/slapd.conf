# This is an OpenLDAP configuration file example which came with the
# APC action applications package. If you install the OpenLDAP server
# for the action applications, put this file to /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
# (on some non-rpm based installations this might be /etc/slapd.conf)
# and edit it according to the comments below. Remember to also put these
# files into the /etc/openldap directory:
# 	slapd.at.netscape.conf
# 	slapd.at.apc.conf
# 	slapd.oc.netscape.conf
# 	slapd.oc.apc.conf
#
# This file was derived from the original slapd.conf file which comes with
# the OpenLDAP package.
#
# See slapd.conf(5) for details on configuration options.
# This file should NOT be world readable.
#

# The include directives include the configuration information from the
# specified files. .at. files contain attributes, .oc. files contain
# object class definitions. While the .at.conf and .oc.conf files contain
# standard information which comes with the OpenLDAP server, the 
# *netscape* files provide data strucutres for database access by netscape
# communicator and the *apc* files provide the data structures required by
# apc action applications.

# Examples:
# access to attr=mail
#	by group="cn=Test,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" write
# access to dn="ou=Manon,o=(.*),c=(.*)"
#               attrs=children,entry,uid
#               by  group="cn=Managers,o=$1,c=$2" write
#               by  dn=".*" read
#
# access to attr=userpassword 
#	by self write
#	by * none
#

# We want to provide access to the database to nobody but us:
defaultaccess   none

# substitute the dn in the following 'by...' line with your own!
# keep the "aauser", only change the ou= values if you want
# This allows the user to change her password:
access to dn.subtree="ou=AA"
          attr=userpassword
        by dn="cn=aauser,ou=AA" write
        by * auth

# do the same again here.
# This allows general write access to the aauser and general
# read access to anyone else.
access to dn.subtree="ou=AA"
        by dn="cn=aauser,ou=AA" write
        by * read
