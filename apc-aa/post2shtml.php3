/**
 * Allows to POST data to a PHP script SSI-included in a .shtml page.
 *
 * You can't use the POST method directly for .shtml pages, you must always use GET,
 * which has several disadvantages: the length of all parameters is limited by
 * a small size and the parameters appear in the URL.
 *
 * But post2shtml helps you. Instead of using
 *     <form action="some_page.shtml" method="get">
 * you write
 *     <form action="/aa/post2shtml.php3?shtml_page=some_page.shtml" method="post">
 *
 * The script works in these steps:
 *
 * 1. All the data coming in POST, GET, COOKIES and FILES is serialized and stored
 *    into the database, table post2shtml, with a new unique ID post2shtml_id
 * 2. The web server is redirected to "some_page.shtml?post2sthml_id=aa45db3d345de..."
 * 3. The web server parses the page "some_page.shtml" and comes to some
 *    SSI include like <!--#include virtual="/aa/some_script.php3"-->. It calls
 *    the PHP script some_script.php3.
 * 4. some_script.php3 knows it may be called this way and thus uses the post2shtml_id
 *    to find the right row in the post2shtml table and thus
 *    retrieve the form data with the function add_post2shtml_vars()
 *    from include/util.php3.
 *
 * One additional feature:
 * You can send passwords, which are stored encrypted by MD5: all members of
 * a md5[] array will be encrypted and stored outside the array. For example if you
 * add &lt;INPUT TYPE=password NAME="md5[password]"&gt; then after calling
 * add_post2shtml_vars() a global variable $password contains the encrypted password.
 * (CHANGE: 06/19/2003 Honza - we no longer call md5() function on passwords -
 *  we call crypt($password,'xx') function instead. crypt() is used for storing
 *  passwords to database (@see /include/itemfunct.php3 insert_fnc_pwd()) - it
 *  uses MD5 on some systems (but on other systems it uses DES?, ...))
 *
 * Parameters: <br>
 *     URL $shtml_page = complete URL of the requested .shtml page
 *
 * If you do not send $shtml_page, no HTTP headers are sent and the post2shtml_id
 * is set as a global variable.
