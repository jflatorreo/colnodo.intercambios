/** @param id  id of AA_Exportsetings object stored on admin/se_export.php page
 *
 *  You can define export to CVS, HTML, XLS on the Admin -> Export file page
 *  and then call the the stored export by the id on /export.php?id=... page.
 *  You can specify the conditions for the export, the bins, the sorting
 *  and the name of outputfile. In all the settings you can use
 *  the {AA expressions}, so it is quite easy to make the export with changeable
 *  conditions (for example if you put "d-year............-=-{qs:year}", then
 *  you will be able to call it like /apc-aa/export.php?id=5357...&year=2012)
