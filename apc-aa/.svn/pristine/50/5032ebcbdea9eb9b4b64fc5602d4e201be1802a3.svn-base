<h2><a name="install_other"></a><a name="s3">3. Installation of Other
Packages needed by ActionApps</a></h2>
<p>These instructions will help you get APC-AA running on a bare-bones
linux box, if you are running apc-aa on a system provided by an ISP
then none of this should be needed, just check that they are running
PHP 4.1.0 or later, and a reasonably up to date version of MySQL.<br>
Note that it's beyond the scope of this document to give you a detailed
information about the installation of production Apache/Mysql hosting
environment. Instead, we just want to outline the installation process
- for further reading check installation documentation for each
component (Apache, Mysql, PHP) . <br>
</p>
<p>A quick test is to upload the apc-aa (as described in <a
 href="install-4.html">install-4.html</a> and then go to <a
 href="http://your.host/apc-aa/test.php3">http://your.host/apc-aa/test.php3</a>,
if that works ok and gives you detailed information on your PHP
installation, then everything else SHOULD be fine.</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.1">3.1 Platform</a> </h2>
<p>The installation instructions given here are intended for use with
RedHat Linux. We used version 7.3 in this example. This specifically
means that the <em>rpm</em> tool is used wherever possible. </p>
<p><em>If your system does not support the rpm tool</em>, most
procedures will be quite different from what is shown here. You will
probably have to do most installations by building the software itself.
It is beyond the scope of this document to describe that although
necessary configurations options will be mentioned. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss3.2">3.2 MySQL database back end</a> </h2>
<p>Check if you have already MySQL 3.22.32 or newer installed: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>% rpm -q MySQL</pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>If MySQL has been installed from source ,then RPM will report it is
not installed,   try "ps efax | grep mysql" to see if it is running,
and if it is then   either "/usr/sbin/mysqld -V" will report the
version on newer versions.   If this doesn't exist then running the
client with, "mysql" should   report the version number it is connected
to. </p>
<p>If it is not installed or if the version used is too old, install
it. The MySQL is now a part of a standard RedHat distribution, so you
should be able to find necessary packages on your RedHat CD-ROM under
/RedHat/RPMS, or download them via FTP from your nearest <a
 href="http://www.redhat.com/download/mirror.html">mirror site.</a> You
can also download RPM  packages directly from <a
 href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html</a>,
but be aware that these packages are different from the ones that ships
with RedHat distributions, so you will have to keep them up to date
manually (they won't update with the OS updates). Use the stable release
version, you probably won't need MAX (version that supports
transactions etc..). </p>
<p> The following instructions assume that you have downloaded RedHat
packages: </p>
<p>As root, install the RPMs: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>     # rpm -Uvh mysql-3.23.49-3.i386.rpm<br>     # rpm -Uvh mysql-server-3.23.49-3.i386.rpm<br>     # rpm -Uvh mysql-devel-3.23.49-3.i386.rpm<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
This command will install the MySQL database server, shared libraray,
client program and headers, create some administrative tables. It also
creates a file <code>/etc/rc.d/init.d/mysqld</code>
<p>Use the script to start the server: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>     # /etc/init.d/mysqld start<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
Since the server is now running, it can be accessed. It is a good idea
to immediately set a password for the MySQL root user. Remind the
password - better not use <em>mysqlpass</em> for obvious reasons. We
will refer to this password as the <em>mysql root password</em>.
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>     # mysqladmin -u root password 'mysqlpass'<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
You probably want the mysql server to start automatically with the
system boot up. To achieve this, use chkconfig to create symbolic links
and symbolic links in <code>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/</code> so the server is
started and stopped properly on system start and shutdown.
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>     # chkconfig --level 345 mysqld on<br>     # chkconfig --level 0126 mysqld off<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss3.3">3.3 OpenLDAP</a> </h2>
<h3>Package Installation</h3>
<p>Note: You only need the OpenLDAP server if you decided to use LDAP
as the permission system. Only do this if you know what you are doing. 
Generally, people use mysql as their permission system</p>
<p> If you want to install OpenLDAP, see the <a href="ldap.html">apc-aa
LDAP page</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss3.4">3.4 Installing the Apache Web Server</a> </h2>
<p>Use the RPM that comes from RedHat. We have had success with many of
the the versions since 1.3.9. You need to install the "devel" packages,
too. </p>
<p>To find out which version of apache httpd you have, use: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>% httpd -v<br>Server version: Apache/1.3.9 (Unix)  (Red Hat/Linux)<br>Server built:   Apr  7 1999 17:17:41<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>To install the apache web server, use these commands. Not that in
this example, the apache itself was already installed, but the
development package was missing (this is the default case for RedHat
Linux). </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre># rpm -Uvh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/apache-1.3.23-14.i386.rpm<br>package apache-1.3.23-14 is already installed<br># rpm -Uvh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/apache-devel-1.3.23-14.i386.rpm<br>apache-devel-1.3.23-14<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>Configuring the web server is a task for a later point in time
because RPM will do part of this work. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="php_install"></a><a name="ss3.5">3.5 PHP</a> </h2>
<h3>PHP installation</h3>
<p>php runs within the apache web server as a module. We need a version
of php   which includes support for <em>two optional php modules</em>,
namely ldap and   mysql. These modules provide access to ldap and mysql
databases, respectively,   from php programs. (If you don't use ldap
with the ActionApps, you   will not need the ldap php support.) </p>
<p>There are many ways to install all this, and many can generate a lot
of trouble.   The cleanest and easiest way is, again, to use RPMs. </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre># rpm -Uvh php-4.1.2-7<br># rpm -Uvh php-mysql-4.1.2-7.i386.rpm<br># rpm -Uvh php-ldap-4.1.2-7.i386.rpm<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<h3>Testing php installation</h3>
<p>First, create a test WWW page to find out the status of php support
on your   system. This can be done easily by executing this command
(assuming <code>/home/httpd/html</code> is your DocumentRoot directory: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>echo "&lt;?php phpinfo() ?&gt;" &gt; /home/httpd/html/test.php</pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
Access the page with a web browser (http://localhost/test.php).
<ul>
  <li>If you see a page beginning with <code>PHP Version</code>, you
have a working     php. Browse through the <code>Configuration</code>
section. Look for an extension     named <code>MySQL</code> and, if you
are using the LDAP permission system,     for one named <code>LDAP</code>.
If both are there, you are lucky because     the php setup is complete;
otherwise, you must install the missing parts. </li>
  <li>If you see the string <code>php phpinfo() ?</code>, you do not
have php4     installed or at least it is not enabled. In which case,
you can try again     with a test file test.php3 which will work if the
PHP3 is installed. APC-AA     should work with this. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss3.6">3.6 Configuring the apache web server</a> </h2>
<p>RedHat &gt;= 8.0 now comes with Apache 2 by default. There are some
major changes in Apache 2 configuration that this guide doen't reflect.
We have several production systems running under Apache 2, however
there were few issues with compatibility between Apache 2 and
PHP.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="install-7.html">Troubleshooting
section</a> of this guide and also <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=6341">mailinglists on
Sourceforge</a> for the latest information about Apache 2 issues.<br>
During the PHP installation using RPMs, most of the configuration work
for the web server is already done. If you didn't use RPM to install
PHP, you might have to do the following steps. (It does no harm to
double check if everything is configured correctly anyway.) </p>
<p>The configuration for the apache takes place in the file <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code>.</p>
<p>You will need the statement <code>Options +Includes</code> there.
This enables the so-called <em>server side includes</em> (SSI) which
are used by the page the users read (which contain the actual content). <b>This
can be a security problem</b> because whoever can edit these pages can
run any command on your web server. (<em>IncludesNOEXEC</em> is not
enough.) You might want to consider to enable this only for the
directories where it is needed with <em>&lt;Directory&gt;</em>
statements. See also the chapter on <a href="install-6.html#security">security</a>
. </p>
<p>In <code>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</code>, make sure these lines
are not commented out: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .php4 .php3 .phtml<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
and
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>AddType text/html .shtml<br>AddHandler server-parsed .shtml<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
"Commented out" means That they are prepended by a "#". Remove the
leading "#" from the lines if it is there.
<p>Add <code>index.php3</code> to the DirectoryIndex line: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.cgi index.php3<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>Restart the web server to reread the configuration files: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre># /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart<br></pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>After these configuration steps, PHP and server side includes should
work. You can test PHP by browsing to your test page ( <a
 href="http://localhost/test.php3">http://localhost/test.php3</a>)
again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To test if SSI works, create sample .shtml file. This can be for
example done by executing this command (assuming <code>/home/httpd/html</code>
is your DocumentRoot directory: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>echo "&lt;!--#include virtual="test.php"--&gt;" &gt; /home/httpd/html/test.shtml    </pre>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p>Now test it by browsing to your test page ( <a
 href="http://localhost/test.shtml">http://localhost/test.shtml</a>).
You should see the same output as when browsing test.php3 page. If not,
reffer to the SSI documentation <a
 href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/ssi.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/ssi.html</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="ss3.7">3.7 PHP.INI and PHPLIB installation</a> </h2>
<p>Installing PHP lib is no longer necessary, it comes with APC-AA
software now. </p>
<p> However, there are still some informations about the php engine
setting, which APC-AA software requires at the moment (will not in
future releases) . First use the php test page ( <a
 href="http://localhost/test.php">http://localhost/test.php</a>) you
have to check what the current values are. If some of the values is not
in order (see below), you may need to edit the php.ini (or php3.ini) or
httpd.conf, and change few   configuration lines, this file is
typically <code>/etc/httpd/php.ini </code>or <code>/etc/php.ini </code>
or <code>/usr/local/lib/php.ini</code> </p>
<p> Edit php.ini so the lines looks something like this: </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>    allow_call_time_pass_reference = On<br>    register_globals = On                 ; needed so that POST parameters end up in global variables<br>    magic_quotes_gpc = On                 ; needed to avoid various bugs with untested code!<br>    file_uploads= On<br><br>      </pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p> Alternatively, you can set these up localy in the corresponding     
section of  apache configuration, in <code> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf </code> </p>
<blockquote><code> </code>
  <hr>
  <pre>    php_flag allow_call_time_pass_reference  On<br>    php_flag register_globals  On<br>    php_flag magic_quotes_gpc  On<br>    php_flag file_uploads On<br>    </pre>
  <code></code>
  <hr> </blockquote>
<p> Restart the webserver to use the new settings file.</p>
