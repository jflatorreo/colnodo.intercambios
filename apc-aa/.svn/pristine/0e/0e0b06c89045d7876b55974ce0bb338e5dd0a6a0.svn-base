<h2><a name="requirements"></a><a name="s2">2. Requirements /
Preconditions / Suggested Environment</a></h2>
<h2><a name="ss2.1">2.1 Hardware Requirements</a> </h2>
<p>The ActionApps can run on every computer which runs one of the
supported operating systems. </p>
<p>There is probably a minimum requirement in terms of processor speed
and amount of memory. If the ActionApps run on a single computer
(including the MySQL database back end), it should be no less than a
200 MHz processor and 64 MByte of RAM. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name="ss2.2">2.2 Software Requirements</a> </h2>
<p>Note: There are instructions for the installation of all software
modules but   the operating system in the next chapter: <a
 href="install-3.html#install_other">Installation   of other packages
needed by the ActionApps</a> which also contains   instructions on how
to check the version numbers of installed packages. </p>
<h3> Operating System</h3>
<p>The primary supported operating system is GNU/Linux. However, the
ActionApps should run on any unix or unix-like operating
system which can run all the other software components. The ActionApps
are being developed and tested on <b>Red Hat Linux</b> from 6.0 to
9&nbsp; (Apache v1, v2),&nbsp; so it is recommended to use this OS.
This installation guide has a strong focus on Red Hat Linux. </p>
<p>It is known that ActionApps also run on FreeBSD 2.2.7. Quite a few
people are also running personal AA instalation under Windows using <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpdev5">phpdev</a> environment. <br>
</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Database Server</h3>
<p>An SQL database server is needed by the ActionApps in order to store
all the information. The only supported SQL server so far is the <b>MySQL</b>
database server. The data is organized in several tables in the
database. ActionApps need one logical database within the
database server. The server can be used for other
applications/database&nbsp; as well. </p>
<p>The database server does not need to be on the same machine as the
other components are. </p>
<p>ActionApps need at least MySQL version 3.22.32. Older version may
work but have not been tested, and they contain known security holes. </p>
<p>If you want to use a different database server than MySQL, for
example, if you have already a database server running, you will have
to do some porting work. ActionApps were written with database back end
portability in mind, and as little as possible MySQL specific functions
were used. It is important that there is PHP support for the database
server you want to use. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Permission System</h3>
<p> Most people will use their Database Server as their permission
system -- storing passwords and permissions in mysql. </p>
<p>If you want to use LDAP as the permission system, you should refer
to <a href="ldap.html">apc-aa ldap page</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WWW (http) Server</h3>
<p>The ActionApps have been developed and tested with the <b>apache</b>
http server. Other http servers might work, too, but there are some
things to consider: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The ActionApps relay on a feature in the apache http server which
 allows to pass GET parameters (query strings) to scripts which are run
from     a SSI (server side include) command in a page. It is known
that the Microsoft     Internet Information Server prior to version 5,
for example, does not do that. At a certain point (apc-aa ver. 2.6)
Action Apps were ported to run under Zeus web server - but this
compatibility probabaly not going to be maintained in the future.&nbsp;
 </li>
  <li>The apache http server can be configured to load PHP as a <em>module</em>.
This speeds things up a lot because the PHP interpreter does not have
to be     loaded every time a PHP script runs. ActionApps work in CGI
mode     as well, though. </li>
  <li>Apache needs the apache-devel module as well.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>PHP</h3>
<p>ActionApps are written in PHP. The minimum version to use should be
PHP 4.2.0.  Older versions of APC-AA should work on anything from PHP
3.0.7, but there are no guarrantees since we no longer test on versions
pre 4.2.0.<br>
</p>
<p>PHP can be build as a <em>module for the apache http server</em> or
as a <em>standalone program</em>. The first way is preferred for
performance reasons. </p>
<p>Your PHP needs optional modules: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A module is needed to access your SQL database. For example, if
you are   using MySQL as the database, you need the MySQL module for
PHP. </li>
  <li>It is recommended to install the GD module to support image
manipulation. PHP &gt;= 4.3.0 comes with complied-in GD support, for
the earlier version consult&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/phppatch.html">"patching PHP for gd
2.0.8 and up"</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are using LDAP as the permission system, you need the LDAP
module   for PHP. </li>
</ul>
<p>The modules can be </p>
<ul>
  <li><em>compiled into PHP</em> or </li>
  <li><em>loaded at run time</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Both ways are described in the <a href="install-3.html#php_install">PHP
installation   section</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="ss2.3">2.3 Know-How Requirements</a> </h2>
<p>To install the ActionApps, you will need some basic unix skills. You
should have installed programs before and be familiar with
administration of your system. </p>
<p> </p>
